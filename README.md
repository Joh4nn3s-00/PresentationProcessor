# PresentationProcessor

A tool for processing presentation videos.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Main application code
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts and tools
- `data/`: Working directory for processed data
- `videos/`: Local storage for video files (not tracked by git)

## Setup

1. Create the conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n PresentationProcessor python=3.10
conda activate PresentationProcessor
```

## Development

The project is structured to potentially support containerization in the future, with clear separation of concerns between data, application code, and utilities.
